# Better than Never


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Gotham


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Joseph Sajan - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Eshaan James  - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
You have to get someplace but there is no way you're getting there early, your wayy too cool to reach on time or you really don't want to go or let's say the host isn't exactly on your good side. How are you gonna be late without an over-complicated explanation of whys?
A map that will take you where you want to go with a slight delay


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Google maps gives you the fastest and shortest route to any destination 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Add an extra few hours to the mix so now it's Google maps that made you late by taking the longest route available.
With an API integration,Google maps is going to be a solution to all the hassles that come with showing up late to an event or destination.
Would you make it on time? Sure with only a 2 hours setback cause "Google maps" showed me the "wrong" route.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: HTML
- Frameworks: Leaflet Routing Machine
- Libraries: Leaflet.js for map interactivity, OpenStreetMap for map tiles, Nominatim API for geocoding
- Tools: VS Code, Figma



### Implementation
For Software:

# Run

as you can see to get the destination route we need to wait until the timmer runs out

this is the final outcome after the timmer finishes
